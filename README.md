# Image Transformation
This repository contains code for transforming images using various techniques such as affine transformations, shearing, rotation, etc.

# Overview
Image transformation is a common task in computer vision and image processing. It involves applying various geometric operations to an image to achieve desired effects like rotation, scaling, shearing, and translation.

# Features
Affine Transformation: Transform images using affine matrices.
Shearing: Shear images along x or y-axis.
Rotation: Rotate images by a specified angle.
